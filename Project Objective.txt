                           Amazon Trade
Problem Statement: Amazon Trade is a company which ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods)
all over the world.

Issue: 
The Shipping Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are
processed and shipped on a monthly basis.

Solution:
He would like a dashboard of this where he selects
a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be
shipped.
